## Product Sales Analysis by Country and Gender

This repository contains a simple program that analyzes the number of products sold based on the number of products brought, categorized by country and gender. The purpose of this program is to provide insights into the sales performance across different demographics.

### How It Works

The program takes as input a dataset containing information on the number of products brought and sold, along with the corresponding country and gender. It then processes the data and generates a report that shows the total number of products sold for each country and gender category.

### Dataset Format

The dataset should be in a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format, with the following columns:

- `Country`: Represents the country where the sales occurred.
- `Gender`: Represents the gender of the customer.
- `Products Brought`: Indicates the number of products brought by the customer.
- `Products Sold`: Indicates the number of products sold to the customer.

Here is an example of how the dataset should be structured:

```
Country,Gender,Products Brought,Products Sold
USA,Male,10,8
USA,Female,15,12
Canada,Male,5,5
Canada,Female,20,18
```

### Running the Program

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.6 or higher).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code files.
3. Place your dataset file (in CSV format) in the same directory as the program file.
4. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the program.
5. Run the following command to execute the program:

   ```

   ```

6. The program will process the dataset and generate a report showing the total number of products sold by country and gender.
7. The report will be displayed in the console and saved to a file named `sales_report.txt`.
